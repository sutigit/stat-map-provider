## Overview

Thanks for viewing this project. This project serves as a collection of vector maps sourced from various countries, focusing on administrative regional divisions such as provinces and municipalities and compatibility with [PxWeb API](https://www.scb.se/en/services/statistical-programs-for-px-files/px-web/) statistics in mind. My goal is to provide open-source collection of regional vector maps to promote free and high-quality assets for educational purposes through an easy to use interface. Please always respect the data sources and licenses of the maps listed below at the [attributions](#attributions) section.

## Features

- **Accurate vector maps:** Currently only including Finland.
- **Administrative regional divisions:** Country maps are divided by municipalities or provinces, for statistical showcasing of demographic data.
- **PxWeb statistics compatible:** The GeoJSON format includes necessary and useful information that can be used together with data from PxWeb databases.
- **Open Data:** All vector maps are sourced from platforms with creative commons licenses.
- **Free to Use:** The project is entirely free, promoting widespread use and collaboration.
- **GeoJSON Format:** Maps are provided in the versatile and widely-supported GeoJSON format, suitable for web applications, GIS software, and more.
- **Optimized CRS:** Each map uses the most accurate Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for its respective country, enhancing spatial precision.

## Current Status

- **Initial Release:** Covers only Finland and can be used only in node projects.
- **Map Types:** Provinces and municipalities
- **Interface:** Node.js
- **Growth:** Actively expanding to include additional countries and interface in multiple programming languages.


## Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

To ensure the highest spatial accuracy, each country's vector maps are provided in the most suitable CRS for that region. For instance:

- **Finland:** Uses **EPSG:3067 (ETRS89 / TM35FIN)**, which is optimized for Finland's geography.
- **Other Countries:** Will adopt their respective national CRS or the most accurate projection system available.

> **Note:** While **EPSG:4326 (WGS 84)** is widely used globally, opting for country-specific CRS enhances the precision of spatial data, especially for detailed administrative boundaries.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```
npm install https://github.com/sutigit/stat-map-provider.git
```

### Usage
**Importing**
```
import StatMap, { Country, AdministrativeLevel } from 'stat-map-provider';
```
**Example usage**
```
const municipalities = new StatMap(Country.FINLAND, AdministrativeLevel.MUNICIPALITY);

const provinces = new StatMap(Country.FINLAND, AdministrativeLevel.PROVINCE);
```
